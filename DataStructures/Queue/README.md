# Queue

## What is Queue Data Structure?
1. A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

2. In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.

3. The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue. Other operations may also be allowed, often including a peek or front operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.

4. The operations of a queue make it a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection. Queues are common in computer programs, where they are implemented as data structures coupled with access routines, as an abstract data structure or in object-oriented languages as classes. Common implementations are circular buffers and linked lists.

FIFO Principle of Queue
- A Queue is like a line waiting to purchase tickets, where the first person in line is the first person served. (i.e. First come first serve).
- Position of the entry in a queue ready to be served, that is, the first entry that will be removed from the queue, is called the front of the queue(sometimes, head of the queue), similarly, the position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most recently added, is called the rear (or the tail) of the queue. See the below figure.

```typescript
type QNode<T> = {
    value: T,
    next?: QNode<T>
}

class Queue<T> {
    public length: number;
    private head?: QNode<T>;
    private tail?: QNode<T>;

    constructor() {
        this.head = this.tail = undefined;
        this.length = 0;
    }

    log(): void {
        let node = this.head;
        while (node) {
            console.log(node.value);
            node = node.next;
        }
    }
    enqueue(item: T): void {
        const node = { value: item } as QNode<T>
        this.length++;
        if (!this.tail) {
            this.tail = this.head = node;
            return;
        }
        this.tail.next = node;
        this.tail = node;
    }
    deque(): T | undefined {
        if (!this.head) {
            return undefined;
        }
        this.length--;
        const head = this.head;
        this.head = this.head.next;
        head.next = undefined;
        return head.value;
    }
    peek(): T | undefined {
        return this.head?.value;
    }
}
```
